  content: "Luchelle was a super host! She was very responsive and despite my late check-in, had someone greet us and show us her suite. The room is exactly as described and was very spacious for the 3 of us. We used the pool at Vista Mar and it was family friendly and very clean. We were also able to enjoy 50% off at their restaurants which made for cheap and delicious meals. There is also a free shuttle to New Mactan should you want to eat at other restaurants."

  content: "Luchelle apartment was a great place to stay for a couple of nights whilst waiting for a flight. The apartment was lovely, everything we needed and very comfortable bed. Communication with Luchelle was excellent and we enjoyed using the pool at the Vista Mar. Food choices were limited and not brilliant at the hotels so need to get a taxi out- nowhere to walk to."
